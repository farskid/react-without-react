# What is the problem then?

<ul>
  <Appear>
    <li>Adding up to Runtime job</li>
    <li>Scripting time ==> Slower bootstrap time</li>
    <li>Asset size: 95.8 (RD) + 5.9 (R) = 101.7</li>
    <li>Not using the platform</li>
    <li>Shipping native platform bindings, not the framework!</li>
  </Appear>
</ul>

---

# The idea

- Ship UX and not the DX (React)
- Save great DX stuff such as React for development
- Compile native bindings to do the required job
- Native bindings: Native mobile, DOM, Web Components, WASM, ...

# What about React then?

# When does it make sense?

<ul>
  <Appear>
    <li>Small apps, less components == decrease in total bundle size</li>
    <li>
      Code splitted apps == without react,react-dom initial bootstrap is faster
    </li>
    <li>👆 Gatsby and Next.js apps 👆</li>
    <li>Compile React Components to WC == no need to ship React</li>
    <li>
      Apps with lots of component instances ==> native bindings are faster and
      has less overhread
    </li>
    <li>
      Apps with focus on low-end devices ==> native bindings are faster and has
      less overhread
    </li>
  </Appear>
</ul>

# Notes

- It's still a proof of concept.
- Supports all React features besides Suspense and Inceremental rendering.
- Alternatives might be choosing Elm or Reason.
- A last resort might also be Preact and hyperApp.

# Demo time

👉 only bundle size for now

- Note that it's still POC
